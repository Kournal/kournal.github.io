{"name":"Kournal","tagline":"Main Kournal website","body":"# Kournal\r\n\r\nKournal is written from scratch tablet journal application. Similar to Xournal(++), but based on Qt5 framework,\r\nrather than GTK+. For now it's under heavy development, so it shouldn't be used in production environment.\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute in making Kournal the best tablet journal software in the world you can contact\r\nme by email: marek@pikula.co.\r\n\r\nTranslations are implemented, but strings will be surely changed a lot of times, so there's no point in\r\ntranslating at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nKournal uses CMake as its build engine. You can configure and build it this way:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Kournal/Kournal.git\r\ncd Kournal\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake ..\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nEntire Kournal project is licensed under GNU General Public License v2 or later.\r\n\r\nThe only exception are imported files licensed on their own, as well as some custom CMake scripts (under BSD\r\nLicense).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
